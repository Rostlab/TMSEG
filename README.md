Readme by Muriel Keribin & Cyril Duchon-Doris

## Description

MSEG predicts transmembrane proteins (TMP) and transmembrane helices (TMH) using position-specific scoring matrices (PSSM) generated by PSI-BLAST and the physico-chemical properties of the amino acids. The prediction is divided into three steps performed by three different classifiers.

Started work in 2004, first commit 09/02/2014, last on 01/02/2014
Released a second version (TMSEG 2) in november 2015 on https://github.com/BernhoferM/TMSEG2. The repo was then forked to Rostlab/ namespace and work should continue from there

## Programming Language

Program installable with autotools for linux platforms.

The program itself is coded in java and exported in a .jar file. Source files available under src/

## Machine learning methods

 *  Random Forest (RF) decision trees
   *  predicts the probability of each residues to be in one of three states: transmembrane, soluble, and signal peptide. The RF uses a sliding window of 19 residues for the PSSM scores and 9 residues for the physico-chemical properties (charge, hydrophobicity, polarity). The protein sequence is then divided into transmembrane and soluble segments (and signal peptide, if applicable) based on the probabilities. 
   * predicts the inside/outside topology of the N-terminus. The prediction is based on the amino acid composition and positive charge of the residues on the two sides of the membrane (separated by the TMHs). 
 *  Neural Network (NN) refines the prediction by adjusting the position of the TMHs or potentially splitting very long TMHs (>36 residues). This NN is specifically trained on the length, amino acid composition, and physico-chemical properties of TMHs. 

 
## Inputs/Outputs

* IN : PSSM Matrix file generated by PSI-BLAST
* IN : FASTA file (nucleotide sequence)
* OUT : Human readable file
* OUT : Raw prediction scores

## How-to and compatibility

The program has been compiled into a .jar that can easily be executed :

``java -jar tmseg.jar -i examples/query.fasta -p examples/query.pssm -o tests/query.out``

The project can be loaded from eclipse (a .project and .classpath were added by us)

Because of JAVA portability, the program should work under any OS that can run a JVM v6+.
* WINDOWS : OK, from CMD
* DEBIAN : OK
* UBUNTU : OK
* MacOSX : UNTESTED
