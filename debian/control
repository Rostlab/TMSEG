Description: Transmembrane helix prediction in proteins
 TMSEG predicts transmembrane proteins, the position
 of their transmembrane helices, and their topology
 within the membrane. TMSEG uses evolutionary information
 in the form of sequence profiles (PSSM). These profiles
 are generated by PSI-BLAST (blastpgp).
